    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be procedurally generating 1000 unique generalization scenarios for each of the 9 unique types of scenarios. Then we evaluate the deceptive response rate of the baseline Mistral 7B v0.2 model on the first 250 examples from each of the nine generalization scenarios. On top of this, we will evaluate the five checkpoints produced with SOO Fine-Tuning on the same nine unique generalization scenarios. We find that for all of the main (first seven) generalization scenarios, SOO Fine-Tuning strongly decreased the deceptive response rate compared to baseline, with the additional generalization scenarios (\"Treasure Hunt\" and \"Escape Room\") demonstrating the limits of generalization. \n"

    "- we generated 1000 unique variations of the 9 generalization scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "- we used the first 250 from each scenario to determine the deceptive response rate of the baseline Mistral 7b v0.2 model \n",
    "\n",
    "- we then evaluated the five checkpoints produced with SOO Fine-Tuning on the same sample of generalization scenarios \n",
    "\n",
    "- we found that in all of the main generalization scenarios (the first seven), the checkpoints produced with SOO Fine-Tuning have significantly lower deceptive response rate than the baseline \n",
    "\n",
    "- we found that in the additional scenario \"Treasure Hunt\", the deceptive response rate was moderately improved from 98% to 57%\n",
    "\n",
    "- in the last additional generalization scenario called \"Escape Room\", we found that the deceptive response rate was not improved almost at all, and we hypothesize that this is due to fine-tuning focusing on \"stealing\" which might not generalize well to \"finding\" objects\n",
